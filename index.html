        <blockquote cite="https://google.com">The staff at Kam's Animal Shelter clearly takes pride in the care they provide their animals, and the services they provide to our community. Our family was treated with nothing but kindness as we looked for a new cat to call our own. Thank you for connecting us with Nugget and for saving so many animals!</blockquote>
