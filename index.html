            <p>The staff at Kam's Animal Shelter clearly takes pride in the love and care they provide their animals, and the services they provide to our community. Our family was treated with nothing but kindness as we looked for our next cat. Thank you for connecting us with Nugget and for helping save so many animals!</p>
